# EZLogger
An very easy and small logger made in Go.
## How to use?
Just add this repository to your project "go.mod", then you can do:<br>
Info - log.Info("Some information appeared on screen.")<br>
Error - log.Error("Some error has happened!")<br>
Warn - log.Warn("Something can fail!")<br>
Debug - log.Debug("Some debug information will be nice to see.")
## Why EZLogger?
I said "very easy and small logger", so I recommend you to use another logger.<br>
This logger is just created for education purposes.<br>
And BTW, this is my first Go project where I put something into () when creating functions :)<br>
I'm not best in Go, so don't except that I will add tags, coloring and more to this logger. As I said, it's "very easy and small logger".
## How to make my own logger (with very easy way)?
1. Download this repository and unpack it to new directory (because you will download .zip)<br>
2. In some IDE (or text editor with "Open directory" option like Sublime Text) open directory that you unarchived and enter it<br>
3. Edit go.mod file (line 1, and edit this link to another)
4. (I think) This repository's code is very easy to understand, so go to "log" directory and edit files. You can also create new files, like "fatal.go" (but I think fatal is very bad option in loggers)<br>
5. Enjoy!
